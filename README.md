<hr>

A repository that contains ```Java``` applications made using the [```Spring Framework```](http://spring.io/)

This repository will host all the ```Java``` applications that I have made using the Spring Framework. Most of the applications 
will only demonstrate the basic concepts of the Spring Framework. 

The repository will gradually come to host programs that accomplish sensible tasks.

**Enjoy your drink !**
